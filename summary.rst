Summary
*******

CodeBug Connect runs programs from its 1MB of inbuilt storage. These programs 
are written in the Python language, but you don't need to know Python. 
You can create programs by dragging and dropping blocks on the CodeBug website.
Once you've completed your program, you need to transfer it onto your CodeBug. 
You can do this:

* with one button click from the CodeBug website over the Internet (provided 
  your CodeBug Connect can also access the Internet!)
* with a direct connection to your CodeBug from your web browser over WiFi
  (Internet connection not required)
* over USB, with CodeBug Connect appearing as a removable disk drive.


Connecting using WiFi
=====================

Using CodeBug Connect with WiFi also lets you interact with your programs; 
so you can print messages, see errors or provide data by typing in. It does 
mean your CodeBug has to be connected to WiFi, and your computer will need to 
be able to connect to it. For maximum flexibility, there are a number of ways 
you can connect.

Using an existing Access point
------------------------------

This is probably the most common use case, your CodeBug connect will connect 
to a WiFi access point, such as your home, school or office router, or tether 
to a mobile phone. This means CodeBug Connect can access to the Internet. 
It also usually means other computers connected to the same access point 
will be able to connect to the CodeBug Connect.


CodeBug Connect's Built in access point
---------------------------------------

CodeBug Connect can host its own access point for you to connect your computer.
This setup is great if you're somewhere without WiFi, or for before you've added
the username and password of the access point you want CodeBug to connect to. 

 .. note:: If your computer is usually connected to the Internet over WiFi, when it
  connects to CodeBug's access point, neither your computer nor CodeBug will be able
  to access the Internet.

Read more about using accessing CodeBug Connect over a :doc:`network`.


Connecting with USB
===================

To make CodeBug Connect appear as a USB drive, press and hold the centre of button
 A while plugging CodeBug in. Transfer or edit your files like you would any other
 on your computer.

.. warning:: To avoid corrupting the files, never unplug CodeBug connect without
 first chosing eject or equivalent in your operating system.

In USB mode, CodeBug does not run your programs. If it did there would be a risk 
that the filesystem would be accessed by both your programs and via USB at the 
same time which would lead to corruptiong. As such, after transferring files you 
must safely eject and then unplug and replug your CodeBug Connect for it to run 
your program. 

.. note:: CodeBug can hold many files and programs, so need to be told which one
 to run at boot. See :doc:`boot` for more information.
