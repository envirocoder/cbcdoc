Can't wait to get started with your new CodeBug Connect? This guide will help you get the most out of it.

Introduction
===========

You can create programs by dragging and dropping blocks on the CodeBug website, or writing text based Python. Once you've completed your program, you need to transfer it onto your CodeBug. Do this in one of three ways:

* Use CodeBug Connect as a USB disk drive and transfer files using through your computer's file manager.

* Connect directly to CodeBug Connect from your webrowser and edit files directly or transfer files via drag and drop into your browser.

* Schedule a remote transfer from the CodeBug Website. Next time your CodeBug Connect checks in it will fetch the new program. (To do this your CodeBug Connect requires Internet access and you must have 'adopted it' into your account.)

Creating your first program
===========================

#. Visit |codebug_editor_link| and login or create a new account.

.. |codebug_editor_link| raw:: html

  <a href="https://www.codebug.org.uk/newide" target="_blank">CodeBug Connect Editor</a>


#. From the main menu choose ``CODEBUG CONNECT`` â†’ ``MY PROJECTS``

Transferring your program to a physical CodeBug Connect
=======================================================

Once you have created your first program and checked it works in the simulator you need to transfer it to your physical CodeBug Connect. This guides uses USB disk mode, which doesn't require using the WiFi. For other ways to transfer, or if your device cannot connect with USB (e.g. iPads, some smartphones etc.) see :doc:`connection_modes`.

#. Click ``DOWNLOAD`` and save the file to your computer.

#. Disconnect CodeBug Connect from all power sources.

#. Press and hold the centre of Joystick A in while plugging CodeBug Connect into your computer's USB port. Keep it held until `USB` scrolls across in yellow. CodeBug Connect will show a yellow file icon when ready.

   .. note:: Some computers, particularly Apple Macs, may take a few seconds to recognise CodeBug Connect as a disk.

#. Transfer the file you have downloaded to replace the ``boot.py`` file on your CodeBug Connect.

   .. warning:: You must make sure your program is transferred onto your CodeBug as ``boot.py`` and exactly that. ``boot-1.py`` or anything else will not be run. Be aware that some web browsers rename downloaded files, in which case you need to rename it back.

   .. note:: CodeBug Connect will always start by running the ``boot.py`` file.   See :doc:`boot` for more information.

#. Eject (or for some operating systems unmount) the CodeBug Connect USB disk before unplugging. On most computers (not some Apple Macs) the yellow file icon on CodeBug Connect will turn green indicating it's safe to unplug.

#. Replug your CodeBug and it should begin running your program.

Great, you've created and transferred your first program over USB disk mode.

USB disk mode is great when you don't want to connect over WiFi. Typically you'll use USB mode to grab a data file CodeBug has collected, or when you want to transfer a finished program or make a quick change to a configuration.

When you're creating a new program you'll typically make lots of changes and want to instantly see the result or any errors produced. For this, we recommend you use CodeBug Connect with WiFi. Follow the :doc:`setup_wifi` guide.
